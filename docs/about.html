        <h2>The Problem </h2>
        <p>
            Theorems, definitions, axioms, and conjectures are the tools
            of mathematics. However, they are recorded in books, papers,
            and websites spread across the internet, and can be difficult to
            find.
        </p>
        <p>
            To find, for example, what theorems are known that describe when a
            Group is solvable, one can do a keyword search to find articles and
            papers and, after some digging, find Burnside's theorem.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, is that the only theorem that describes when a group is solvable?
            Does Burnside's theorem have alternate forms?
        </p>
        <p>
            Why does one need to search for articles, related to the theorem, and
            read through the articles hoping to find the theorem? Why does one need to
            know that name of the theorem to find it?
        </p>
        <h2>The Solution</h2>
        <p>
            Wouldn't it be better if there was a central place, open for everyone,
            everywhere, to search directly for theorems and definitions by not just
            their name or author but by their content, meaning, and structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is, a place where one doesn't look for an article in the hope of
            finding the desired theorem/definition, but a place to search for the
            theorem/definition directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            If there was a system that aggregated the theorems and definitions of
            mathematics encoded in a way both computers could understand, the system
            could allow one to find math results by their content and structure.
        </p>
        <p>
            It could expand definitions inline in a result to make the result easier to
            understand. It could find similarities between results. It could have
            direct links from a theorem/definition, back to the books, articles, and
            papers that talk about it.
        </p>
        <p>
            It could make it easier for everyone to find the work mathematicians have
            done, use the tools they created, and cite their work.
        </p>
        <p>
            This system is the MathLingua system, and the MathLingua language is the
            language used to encode mathematics in a form that is easy to read and
            write by both people and computers.
        </p>
        <h2>How You Can Help</h2>
        <p>
            The MathLingua system is a community driven effort to populate the system
            with mathematical statements. By encoding your work, or the work of others
            in the system, everyone can more easily find the work along with links
            to the original paper or book. This will help people find each others work
            so that they can use them, build on them, and cite them.

        <h1>The MathLingua Language</h1>
        <h2>An Example</h2>
        <p>
            To understand the MathLingua language, we start with an example of
            encoding the version of the Heine-Borel theorem that states that a
            subset of the real numbers is compact if and only if it is closed
            and bounded.
        </p>
        <pre><code class="yaml">Result:
. for: X
  where:
  . 'X \subset \reals'
  then:
  . iff:
    . 'X is \real.compact \set'
    then:
    . 'X is \real.closed \real.bounded \set'
Metadata:
. name = "Heine-Borel Theorem"
</code></pre>
        <h3>The General Structure</h3>
        <p>
            This example demonstrates the main syntax of the MathLingua language.
            First, the syntax for encoding the structure of the theorem is through
            the use of indentation with groups consisting of sections with names
            followed by a colon, where each section has zero or more arguments.
        </p>
        <p>
            That, is the outermost group is:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="yaml">Result:
Metadata:
</code></pre>
        <p>
            Consisting of the sections <b>Result:</b> and <b>Metadata:</b>. The
            <b>Result:</b> section has a single argument, indicated by the period
            (.) and indentation. This argument is the group:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="yaml">for:
where:
then:
</code></pre>
        <p>
            This group has sections <b>for:</b>, <b>where:</b>, and <b>then:</b>.
            The only argument for the <b>for:</b> section is the identifier <i>X</i>.
            The only argument for the <b>where:</b> section is the statement
            <i>'X \subset \reals'</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This group specifies that for the given identifiers(s) specified in the
            <b>for:</b> section, where those identifiers satisfy the conditions in
            the <b>where:</b> section, then the items in the <b>then:</b> section
            hold.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note that argument(s) for a section can appear on the same line of a
            the section separated by commas (as illustrated in the <b>for:</b> section),
            or on separated lines with a period and space (`. `) prefix (as
            illustrated in the <b>where:</b> section).
        </p>
        <p>
            The <b>then:</b> section has a single element, which is the following group:
        </p>
        <pre><code class="yaml">iff:
then:
</code></pre>
        <p>
            The <b>iff:</b> section only has a single argument, which is the statement
            <i>'X is \real.compact \set'</i>, and the <b>then:</b> section only has a
            single argument which is the statement
            <i>'X is \real.closed \real.bounded \set'</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            This group specifies that the items in the <b>iff:</b> section all hold
            if and only if the items in the <b>then:</b> section hold.
        </p>
        <h3>The Statement Structure</h3>
        <p>
            Note that many of the arguments to section in the above example are
            <i>statements</i> that are enclosed in single quotes. An example is the
            statement <i>'X is \real.closed \real.bounded \set'</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            MathLingua is designed to use a indentation type syntax to specify the
            structure of a mathematical result, while a distinct LaTeX like syntax
            is used to describe statements inside single quotes.
        </p>
        <p>
            This statement language is inspired by but not a superset of LaTeX.
            In particular, commands are specified as starting with a backslash (\)
            like in LaTeX, but the use of periods (.) show similarities and differences to
            related commands.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, a <i>\real.set</i> and a <i>\complex.set</i> are related but
            unique and the (.) serves to make fully qualified names to identify a command.
        </p>
        <p>
            Further, the <i>is</i> keyword is a special keyword used to state that the
            identifiers on the left side of the <i>is</i> satisfy the items on the
            right side of the <i>is</i>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In addition, the <i>is</i> keyword special in that multiple commands on the
            right side of an <i>is</i> are interpreted as being automatically "glued" to
            the rightmost command.
        </p>
        <p>
            That is, saying that the statement <i>'X is \real.closed \real.bounded \set'</i> is
            true is the same as saying both <i>'X is \real.closed.set'</i> <b>and</b>
            <i>'X is \real.bounded.set'</i> are true.
        </p>
        <p>
            This allows one to succinctly describe that an identifier simultaneously
            multiple conditions similar to how mathematics is typically written.
        </p>
